This is going to be an Android/iOS Glowfic site client!

Optimistically.

I mean, realistically, it's not. I have a baby. I have a cold. I am hopefully
going to start a demanding job in the next week or two. This is mostly an
excuse for me to noodle around with react-native and see what it looks like
when it's integrated with a database and network calls and whatever.

Nonetheless, here are the ambitions of the Glowfic app.

My first intended use case is *reading* because, duh, that's pretty much all I
do with the Glowfic site. The goal is that you can just click 'save' on, say,
Silmaril and then get on an airplane and read Silmaril on your tablet without
buying overpriced inflight internet. Or have the latest updates to the seven
threads you're currently reading sync to your phone while you're at work, and
catch up on the subway whether you have reception or not. Eventually I'll try
to make the app useful for posting as well. I'm thinking I'll go with endless
scroll for threads with a menu that you can use to jump to a particular page,
but I'm open to advice on that.

I'm writing the app with React Native which *should* mean it works on Android
and iOS. If you have XCode and an iOS device, you're welcome to try running it!
It'll mostly be built and tested on Android though.
